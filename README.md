# Marlin 2.0.9.3 configurated for the Ender 3 Pro with SKR Mini E3 2.0 Board and BLTouch


## This is a fork of [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) using the release 2.0.9.3 
## Config file used: [Config for Ender 3 Pro/ SKR Mini E3 2.0](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/archive/release-2.0.9.3.zip)



Changed stuff:

- Added config files to project
- Enabled BLTouch and set z_probe_offset (I'm using this bltouch mount: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3003725)
- Some minor other stuff, feel free to check it out.



Might add in the future:

 - Support for Filament Runout sensor
 - Adjust bed size for clips (Printhead could run into Bed-Attachment-Clips and probably damage them / Bad for Leveling)
 - and more ...
